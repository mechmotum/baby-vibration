# Dimensions of the road surface tile, brick, slab. The length is dimension
# that was traversed and should correspond to the frequency of vibrations,
# except for the klinkers which were aligned ~45 deg relative to the travel
# path and pave which the strollers were pushed in both directions over the
# cobbles, but a likely more over the length dimension.
