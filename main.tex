  % NOTE: keep to 150 words max
  % Knowledge is lacking on road-induced vibrations for infants transported  in
  % strollers and cargo  bicycles.
  The objective of this study was to comprehensively evaluate vibrations with
  dummies representing infants aged 0, 3, and 9 months lying or sitting in five
  strollers and two cargo bicycles with dedicated baby seats on six common road
  surfaces using the ISO standard for whole-body vibration. Strollers induced on
  average 0.4~\si{\mps\squared} on tarmac and up to 5.0~\si{\mps\squared} on
  cobblestones at a mean walking speed of 5.3~\si{\kph}. Cargo bicycles induced
  on average 0.6~\si{\mps\squared} on tarmac and up to 10.7~\si{\mps\squared} at
  25~\si{\kph} on paver bricks. The standard suggests the highest accelerations
  for strollers and cargo bicycles are extremely uncomfortable and continuous
  exposure should be limited to less than 10~\si{\minute}. Vintage strollers
  have reduced vibrations compared to modern strollers, indicating benefits of
  compliant suspensions. We recommend that designers systematically consider
  vibration, users avoid prolonged exposure to surfaces rougher than tarmac, and
  researchers pursue scientifically founded test procedures and standards for
  infant vibration.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Practitioner Summary}
%
Strollers pushed over cobblestones and cargo bicycles travelling over paver
bricks at typical speeds induce infant seat pan accelerations up to 5 and
11~\si{\mps\squared}, respectively. The adult whole-body vibration standard
suggests these accelerations are extremely uncomfortable and continuous exposure
should be limited to less than 10~\si{\minute}.

\section{Introduction}
%
All means of infant transport cause vibration, which is transferred to the
sitting or lying child. Unlike early-century perambulator design
considerations~\cite{behrend1931}, vibration is seemingly not a subject of
attention in the present design of infant transportation products. Modern
strollers do not have much suspension, and cargo bicycles are increasingly used
for infants with seats that offer marginal suspension or padding. We thoroughly
reviewed the literature~\cite{Daams2025} but found very little about the maximal
vibration load that babies and older children can receive during transport
without discomfort or harm, and vibrations generated by infant transport are
only sparsely investigated. Furthermore, only a few studies focus on vibrations
experienced by infants younger than 12 months. To establish the amount of
vibration to which infants are subjected in transportation products, we measured
seat pan vibrations while transporting infant dummies in strollers and cargo
bicycles with a focus on potential health risks and discomfort. In the absence
of infant-specific safety and comfort standards, this paper provides a
measurement framework to target the future development of specific ISO
standards.

The comfort experienced by riders and passengers (e.g. infants/children in cargo
bicycles), is a multifaceted~\cite{ayachi2015identifying} challenge to wide
acceptance of bicycling. The comfort of bicycles~\cite{too1990biomechanics} is
mainly affected by physical comfort and the impact of environmental factors
(weather, route geometry, and road roughness). Physical comfort is related to
mechanical (bicycle and component design), biomechanical (whole-body vibrations,
human body dynamics, and kinematics), and physiological factors (individual
characteristics, e.g. sex, body size, weight). Although there is relevant
literature exploring the impact of environmental factors (i.e., irregular road
surface quality, weather conditions) on cyclist
comfort~\cite{Stinson2003,Hagemeister2003,ayachi2015identifying,Verhoeven2017,Teixeira2020},
there is only limited work on understanding the biomechanical and physiological
factors of comfort of bicycle passengers (infants/children in bicycle seats,
cargo bicycles, or trailers). A particular concern is the transport of infants
under one year of age, who cannot well express any experience of discomfort or
pain. Similar concerns are raised about strollers, where infants are also
exposed to road-induced vibrations.

% Paragraph about transmission of vibrations
Biomechanical comfort is mainly related to vibrations induced by road
irregularities and transmitted through the vehicle to the human
body~\cite{too1990biomechanics}. Road irregularities are a driving factor, as
vibrations induced in children are not efficiently isolated due to the lack of
adequate suspension systems in most bicycle
models~\cite{vasudevan2017comparison} and strollers. The bicycle or stroller
design and the seating configuration affect posture and vibration
transmission~\cite{Brand2020,Verma2016}. Children/infants can be transported
sitting or lying in a different location than the cyclist (e.g. above a wheel
when in a bicycle seat) and in/on a different `seat' (a car seat, bicycle seat,
stroller seat, or cot). Vibrations generally increase with travel speed, for
example, when running with a stroller or due to the increased power offered by
electric bicycles (with and without trailers). For the latter, the average speed
using electric bicycles and speed pedelecs is 19\% higher (21.0~\si{\kph} and up
to 63\% higher (28.1~\si{\kph}), respectively, than conventional
bicycling~\cite{SWOV2022}. The intensity of these vibrations could become even
more critical with the change of load, which is related to the age and size of
the infant/children transported. However, there is limited literature exploring
whole-body vibrations of infants and children transported by bicycle trailers,
cargo bicycles, and strollers~\cite{Ota2012,Ota2014,Kanya-Forstner2020,
vanDriessche2018, Schwanitz2020,MalteChildComfort2022}. Most literature focuses
on comfort rather than health risks.

% Paragraph about children on bicycles
One of the research fields closely related to the vibrations that act on infants
during transportation is that of inflicted head injury by shaking trauma
(IHI-ST). However, there is a lack of reliable, applicable, and validated injury
thresholds to assess IHI-ST risks~\cite{hutchinson2024modeling}. Similarly, even
if there are indications that vibration affects comfort in bicycles or
strollers, there are no standard vibration assessment methods or guidelines
available with respect to their design. ISO~2631~\cite{ISO2631}, the
international standard for assessing whole-body vibrations, was derived using
data sets on motion platforms, with adults as participants and sitting postures
adopted in passenger vehicles rather than on bicycles. Gao~et~al.~\cite{Gao2018}
show this discrepancy with vibration comfort limits for adults riding bicycles,
based on their subjective feedback, tolerating more than the vibration limits
suggested by ISO~2631-1. Furthermore, in ISO~2631-1 the exposure time to
vibrations is not considered a factor in the determination of comfort, despite
having a clear impact on health risks according to the European Directive
(2002/44/EC, 2002)~\cite{directive2002directive}.

% Paragraph Potential effects of vibrations on adults
Despite the lack of knowledge and test methods with regard to comfort or
inflicted head injury by shaking trauma for children/infants on bicycles, there
are clear indications in the literature that these should be considered. About
36\% of males and 42\% of females in a total sample of 900 cyclists had various
discomfort complaints~\cite{groenendijk1992sitting}. Discomfort occurred even
during short bicycle trips (\SIrange{3}{10}{\kilo\meter}). However, the results
of research on the comfort of active adult cyclists cannot be applied directly
to infants or children sitting or lying in transportation systems.

Schwanitz~et~al.~\cite{Schwanitz2020} tested a child bicycle trailer on smooth
tarmac, gravel, and cobblestones using child-shaped sandbag dummies (baby and
toddler sizes) using ISO~2631-1 weightings. Tyre pressure and number of
passengers had no significant effect on vibration magnitude, but the road
surface and travel speed did. The infant dummy (5~\si{\kilo\gram}) experienced a
20\% higher vibration than the toddler dummy (10~\si{\kilo\gram}), while the
measured values generally exceeded the ISO~2631-1 limit for vibrational comfort
of adults. Rothhämel~et~al.~\cite{MalteChildComfort2022} tested a trailer seat
and a tadpole configuration three-wheel cargo bicycle on smooth tarmac and
cobblestones for speeds from \SIrange{10}{20}{\kph} using ISO~2631-1 assessment.
They found a large increase in vibration amplitude on cobblestones compared to
tarmac in the same speed range. The child trailer exhibited larger accelerations
than the cargo bicycle with the child seat between the front wheels. Child seats
in trailers and cargo bicycles generally had vibrations of higher magnitude than
those experienced in a car seat travelling at 30~\si{\kph} on a rough road
\cite{gromadowski2013analysis}. Rothhämel and Liu~\cite{rothhamel2023comfort}
also conducted laboratory measurements with a 6.5~\si{\kilo\gram} mass
representing an infant in a bicycle trailer with various tyre pressures. All
their values fell into the ``extremely uncomfortable'' zone for ISO~2631-1.

In addition to studies with dummies or lumped masses representing infants,
Kanya-Forstner~\cite{Kanya-Forstner2020} measured acceleration in bicycle child
trailers with human subjects aged 12 months to 6 years over tarmac and gravel
terrain (average speed of 12~\si{\kph} over a 20~\si{\minute} ride). According
to the health assessment using ISO~2631-1, the vibrations are similar to those
experienced in child seats in cars and illustrate moderate or low health risk
for a 2~\si{\hour} duration. She points out the importance of correcting for
duration, otherwise the values point to moderate and high risks. The type of
road surface had the greatest influence on the levels of vibration exposure,
followed by the type of trailer, while the gel cushions as support did not
significantly influence the vibration measured at the seat/pan interface.

In the context of infant transportation with stroller seats, Kok
Siong~\cite{lim2018study} carried out an indoor and an outdoor experiment to
capture the vibrations at the seat and backrest of a baby stroller, using
weights from \SIrange{4}{14}{\kilo\gram}, and a child subject of
10.30~\si{\kilo\gram} as well as a dummy weighing 10.30~\si{\kilo\gram}. Comfort
levels (ISO~2631-1) for indoor testing were  `Fairly uncomfortable' to `A little
uncomfortable', where outdoor testing resulted in `Extremely uncomfortable' and
`Fairly uncomfortable' values. The child and dummy provided similar results.
Sierzputowski~et~al.~\cite{sierzputowski2021pilot} tested a modern and an older
stroller on tarmac road, concrete paving blocks, concrete plates, dirt road,
lawn, and damaged concrete. Several conditions resulted in the highest
discomfort levels ($>$2~\si{\mps\squared} according to ISO~2631-1).
Okajima~et~al.~\cite{okajima2020dynamic} tested seven children, sitting upright
in a stroller, riding over a protrusion (13$\times$60~\si{\milli\meter}) with
either one wheel or two wheels. The children were 3 to 6 years old, boys and
girls, weighing \SIrange{15.94}{19.96}{\kilo\gram} with a length of
\SIrange{98.0}{112.4}{\centi\meter}. The heads and chests of the children
exhibited strong vibrations at 1~\si{\hertz} along all three axes (x, y, and z),
vibration along the y-direction at 2~\si{\hertz}, with limited vibration above
8~\si{\hertz}.

The above studies provide experimental evidence of potentially worrying
vibrations in real children, dummies, or simple masses transported in cargo
bicycles, bike trailers, and strollers. Most studies use ISO~2631-1 frequency
weighting and report very or extremely uncomfortable conditions with higher
speeds and rough surfaces, while only one study evaluated health effects. Only a
few studies focus on vibrations experienced by infants under 12 months of age.

This paper provides measurements of vibration exerted on infant dummies in
strollers and cargo bicycles, which may be used as risk indicators for
discomfort or health effects. We equipped five strollers and two cargo bicycles
with inertial measurement units (IMU) and carried out 67 experiments on
different road surfaces and with different travel speeds, using dummies
representing 0, 3, and 9-month-old infants. We derived results using ISO~2631-1
frequency weightings and procedures to enable comparison with previous studies.
However, given that ISO~2631-1 is neither validated for children nor for lying
postures, we also report unweighted results to assess the power spectrum and
bandwidth. We investigated the influence of vehicle, seat, body size, speed, and
road surface and provided recommendations to users, designers, and for future
research. Furthermore, as an example of how such measurements could be used for
assessing discomfort and health effects, we discuss these in the light of
thresholds suggested by ISO~2631-1 and Gao~et.~al~\cite{Gao2018} to benchmark
against these limited, but established, references.

\section{Materials and Methods}
%
\subsection{Test Equipment}
%
Vibration measurements were conducted using five different strollers and two
cargo bicycles with two baby seats, chosen for their popularity and/or
distinctive features. The strollers included three modern strollers:
\underline{Bugaboo} Fox 5 (Bugaboo, Amsterdam, the Netherlands),
\underline{Maxi-Cosi} Street Plus (Dorel Juvenile, Foxborough, USA), and
\underline{Stokke} BABYZEN YOYO 0+ (Stokke, Ålesund, Norway) and two vintage
strollers from unknown manufacturers ``\underline{Green Machine}'' cot-style and
``\underline{Old Rusty}'' seat-style. The cargo bicycles were a delta
configuration tricycle \underline{Keiler} (Keiler Bakfiets, the Netherlands) and
a two-wheel \underline{Urban Arrow} (Pon Bicycle Holding B.V., Amsterdam, the
Netherlands). Each was tested with both seats: Maxi-Cosi X Joolz
\underline{Pebble} Pro i-Size (Dorel Juvenile, Foxborough, USA) and
\underline{Melia} Baby Shell (Melia, Rotterdam, the Netherlands). The underlined
words for each product designate an abbreviated name used in figures and tables
in the paper and Figure~\ref{fig:equipment} shows the tested
products.~\footnote{Supplementary Material ``Experimental Equipment'' provides
more detailed figures and technical descriptions of all tested strollers and
cargo bicycles.}

  vintage strollers and dummies. ALT TEXT: Photos of cargo bicycles, infant
  seats, strollers, and infant dummies.}
  \label{fig:equipment}
\end{figure}

We tested three baby dummies with sizes and weights representative of infants 0,
3, and 9 months. Newborns (`0 months') are the youngest (smallest, lightest)
children transported in strollers with a cot or in rear-facing car seats (such
as the Pebble used in this study). At nine months, on average, infants can sit
up straight by themselves and thus can be transported sitting in a stroller with
a seat or on the bench of a cargo bicycle. Testing with real infants would be
unethical for the most severe conditions and create challenges in terms of
reproducibility. Hence, we bought and adapted commercially available ``Reborn''
dummies (Atelier Wiesje, De Bilt, the Netherlands) shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:equipment}~\footnote{Supplementary Materials ``Experimental
Equipment'' provides full details of the dummies.}. Although newborns are less
frequently transported in strollers and cargo bicycles compared to older
infants, these transport means are still used in daily routines for newborns.
For example, in the Netherlands parents transport newborns by bicycle. Including
newborns in the test matrix is therefore a conservative approach and allows us
to consider the worst-case scenario: newborns have the least developed
musculoskeletal system, have the lowest mass, and are potentially the most
vulnerable group. The weight and body height of the dummies were made to match
the average measures for children of 0, 3 and 9 months old:
3.48~\si{\kg}|50~\si{\cm} 5.90~\si{\kg}|62.5~\si{\cm}, and
8.90~\si{\kg}|70~\si{\cm}, respectively. We used Dutch infant growth charts to
determine the average weight and body height at age 0 months~\cite{TNO/LUMC1998}
and French growth charts for 3 and 9 months~\cite{FrenchGrowthChart} as
requested by the funder; with French children being the smallest in Europe,
while the Dutch are the tallest. The dummies were filled with a mixture of cat
litter, sand, and water to reproduce the mass and mass distribution according to
the body segment information reported in~\cite{Snyder1977}.

\subsection{Measurement Equipment}
%
Linear accelerations and angular velocities were measured tri-axially using
Consensys Shimmer3 IMUs with a Consensys Base 6U.01 dock (Shimmer Sensing,
Dublin, Ireland). The IMUs were updated to firmware version LogAndStream v0.11.0
and managed via the software ConsensysBASIC v1.6.0-64bit on a Dell 7310 laptop
with Microsoft Windows 10. We 3D printed supports (material: PLA) for the
sensors to firmly fix the sensors on the tested bicycle/stroller (small white
and orange boxes visible in Figure~\ref{fig:sensors_UA}). Each vehicle was
equipped with five IMUs. The IMUs under the head and buttocks contacting the
dummy were placed according to the recommended practice in vibration testing
standard ISO-2631-1.~\footnote{Only two sensors were used in this study and
descriptions of the remaining three sensors and detailed drawings showing the
vehicles and the sensors' location are in Supplementary Materials ``Experimental
Equipment''.} This generates acceleration data representative of the mechanical
load transferred from the seat to the human body taking into account the
compliance of the seat foams and the inertia and compliance of the dummy.

  \label{fig:sensors_UA}
\end{figure}

The sampling frequency was set to 910.22~\si{\hertz} for all IMUs. The
full-scale range was set to the sensors' maximum: \(\pm\)16~g for the
accelerometer and \(\pm\)2000\si{\degree\per\second} for the gyroscope. All
tests were recorded with two GoPro Hero7 cameras: one directly mounted on the
strollers/bicycles to capture the dummy-seat relative motion, while the other
was held by an experimenter who was walking or riding along with the vehicle to
have a complete overview of the experiment.

\subsection{Postures}
%
All tested equipment provided full support for the back and head, allowing usage
in lying or reclined postures. Nine-month-old infants are generally able to sit
erect, but will often rest their heads or be asleep. Although sitting upright is
the best posture for children who can sit upright, a more reclined posture was
tested because this allowed measurement of vibration at the head-seat interface
while the head was always supported by the headrest. We tested all systems with
horizontal or reclined postures. The angle of inclination with respect to the
ground is listed in Table~\ref{tab:baby-posture} for each condition tested.

\subsection{Experimental Protocol}
%
All tests were conducted in Delft, the Netherlands, on public roads near Delft
University of Technology~\footnote{Details of all test locations and surfaces
are shown in Supplementary Materials ``Location and Pictures of the Experiment
Areas''.}. After mounting the sensors and reaching the location of the
experiment, we turned on the sensors to start the experimental ``session'',
where a session is a continuous data collection period from a single vehicle
that may include different road surfaces or speeds. Before each trial, we pushed
the vehicle back and forth on level ground to mark the beginning of the session
as an extra time-synchronization measure. For the cargo bicycle, a single rider
conducted all trials to be consistent across different sessions (rider mass:
59~\si{\kg}; rider height: 1.70~\si{\m}). We tested cargo bicycles on tarmac and
paver bricks road surfaces at target speeds of 12~\si{\kph}, 20~\si{\kph}, and
25~\si{\kph}. The stroller tests were conducted on tarmac, paver bricks,
sidewalk pavers, cobblestones, and sidewalk slabs (concrete blocks with gaps in
between) road surfaces~\footnote{We also performed shock experiments but do not
include the results here due to an abundance of sensor saturation. See the
Supplementary Materials ``Shock Tests'' for that information.}.
Figure~\ref{fig:surfaces} shows the road surfaces used for each vehicle type. In
all tests, the speed was manually controlled by the pusher or cyclist by
observing a speedometer mounted on the handlebar of the stroller or cargo
bicycle. We selected convenient road surfaces representative of commonly
occurring urban conditions in Delft. Although these surfaces cover only part of
the full range of worldwide possibilities, we tested at various locations to
capture local variation in surface quality.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Data Processing}
%
We analysed the raw data with a custom data processing pipeline. The open source
MIT licensed code is hosted at
\href{https://github.com/mechmotum/baby-vibration}{github.com/mechmotum/baby-vibration}
and implemented in Python 3.13.1 using the following libraries:
DynamicistToolKit 0.6.1, Matplotlib 3.9.3, NumPy 2.2.0, Pandas 2.2.3, pyyaml
6.0.2, SciPy 1.14.1, and Seaborn 0.13.2. The pipeline generates a website at
\href{https://mechmotum.github.io/baby-vibration}{mechmotum.github.io/baby-vibration}
with an exhaustive collection of figures to examine the quality of the data and
general results for all trials, including the selected tables and figures in
this paper.

Each session was segmented into ``trials'' corresponding to a different road
surface or activity and each trial was divided into subsequent back-to-back
``repetitions''. We divided longer trials into repetitions to expose the
variation of road surface features within a trial. The raw data consists of a
single comma-separated value (CSV) file per session per IMU, along with metadata
for the sessions and vehicles. The CSV file contains the time series data from
each IMU: linear acceleration along and angular speed about each of the
body-fixed orthogonal axes of the IMU alongside Epoch Unix timestamps. We
segmented the sessions into trials representing a motion state of the vehicle:
either static on level ground or being propelled over one of the surfaces of
interest at a constant speed. Figure~\ref{fig:session} gives an example of
segmenting a session in different trials. 

The data were processed per session as follows:

  \label{fig:session}
\end{figure}
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Calculate the vehicle travel speed during the session from the angular
    rate of the rear wheel and the vehicle's wheel radius.
  \item Extract segments representing a single trial from each session time
    history, based on the manually labelled segment ``start'', and ``end''
    times.
  \item Split the trials with durations longer than 40~\si{\second} into
    repetitions of \SIrange{20}{39}{\second}. Trials less than 20~\si{\second}
    are not split.
  \item Rotate the accelerometer data for each sensor from body-fixed sensor
    coordinates to body-fixed vehicle coordinates. This is achieved by rotating
    the coordinate axes about the sensor's body-fixed axis, which was manually
    aligned with the vehicle's pitch axis. We subtracted the mean measured
    acceleration due to gravity (standard gravity) giving the linear
    acceleration of each sensor projected into the vehicle's SAE body-fixed
    axes~\cite{SocietyofAutomotiveEngineers2008}, named: longitudinal $x$,
    lateral $y$, and vertical $z$.
  \item Extract each motion trial segment and select the vehicle body-fixed
    longitudinal, lateral, and vertical component of the seat pan accelerometer.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Analysis}
%
Figure~\ref{fig:vert-acc-example} shows an example time history of the vertical
(\(z\)) acceleration of the seat pan during a single repetition. To perform the
ISO~2631-1 recommended health and comfort analysis, we first downsampled the
time history from the hardware-set variable sampling frequency of approximately
910.22~\si{\hertz} to a constant sample rate of 400~\si{\hertz} using linear
interpolation, giving sufficient samples for the bandwidth of interest based on
the Nyquist frequency. We set any acceleration values outside of the sensor
manufacturer's reported operating range of \(\pm\)16~g to that maximum or
minimum, respectively, given that values outside the range may be unreliable.
Values that exceeded the range are rare, and only present in nine of the cargo
bicycle paver brick repetitions. Following the ISO~2631-1 recommendation, we
low-pass filtered the signal at \(1.5\times80~\si{\hertz}=120~\si{\hertz}\)
using a zero-lag 2\textsuperscript{nd} order Butterworth filter, given that the
standard only applies to frequencies up to 80~\si{\hertz}.

  bottom left. ALT TEXT: Plot of acceleration versus time during an example
  repetition.}
  \label{fig:vert-acc-example}
\end{figure}

ISO~2631-1 provides weighting filters that highlight frequencies that adults are
most sensitive to. To apply them, we calculated the amplitude spectra of the
acceleration time histories of each trial using the Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT). Figure~\ref{fig:freq-spectrum} gives an example of a raw amplitude
spectrum along with smoothed versions of the raw and ISO~2631-1 weighted
signals.  In almost all repetitions, there is a single dominant peak frequency
in the ISO weighted and smoothed spectra. A handful of trials had two or more
peaks at adjacent frequencies of approximately the same amplitude. We selected
the maximum amplitude peak in those cases. Before ISO weighting, the area under
the spectrum curve was calculated and the frequency below which 80\% of the
amplitude content falls was marked as an indicator of bandwidth.

  vertical line indicates the frequency at the maximum amplitude of the smoothed
  curve. The black dashed-dotted vertical line indicates the bandwidth threshold
  for 80\% of the area under the black curve. ALT TEXT: Plot of amplitude versus
  frequency for an example repetition.}
  \label{fig:freq-spectrum}
\end{figure}

We calculated the root mean square (RMS) over \(N\) samples of the downsampled,
low-pass filtered, and ISO 2631-1 weighted vertical component of acceleration
\(a_{w,z}\) at the seat pan for each repetition using Equation~\ref{eq:rms-acc}
to use for the health assessment and the RMS of the magnitude of the 3D
acceleration vector at the seat pan \(\textrm{RMS}_{a_{w,xyz}}\) using
Equation~\ref{eq:rms-acc-mag} for the comfort assessment, as per ISO 2631-1
guidelines. We set the ISO~2631-1 adjustment factors \(k_x,k_y,k_z\) equal to 1
for all acceleration components. RMS gives an indication of the average vertical
acceleration experienced at the infant's buttocks-seat interface for the
duration of the trial and is indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:vert-acc-example} with
black horizontal lines. It is the primary metric recommended by ISO-2631-1 for
evaluation of health and comfort in adult whole-body vibration. We also
calculated the vibration dose value \(\textrm{VDV}_{a_{z}}\) of the raw data
vertical acceleration \(a_{z}\) using \(M\) samples corresponding to the first
10~\si{\second} of the repetition with Equation~\ref{eq:vdv-acc}, indicated in
Figure~\ref{fig:vert-acc-example}. Lastly, we computed the crest factor
\(\textrm{CF}_{a_{z}}\) of the downsampled and low pass filtered vertical
acceleration\footnote{Some scenarios have crest factors larger than 9, but we do
not report metrics other than RMS as ISO~2631-1 recommends for this study.} with
Equation~\ref{eq:crest-factor}. All of these per-repetition metrics are reported
as mean values over the repetitions corresponding to a scenario in
Table~\ref{tab:summary-stroller} and Table~\ref{tab:summary-bicycle}. The
following equations describe the metrics:
%
\begin{align}
  \textrm{RMS}_{a_{w,z}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N} k_z^2 a_{w,z}^2(t_n)}
  \label{eq:rms-acc}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  \textrm{RMS}_{a_{w,xyz}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N} k_x^2 a_{w,x}^2(t_n) + k_y^2 a_{w,y}^2(t_n) + k_z^2 a_{w,z}^2(t_n)}
  \label{eq:rms-acc-mag}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  \textrm{VDV}_{a_{z}} = \left[\sum_{m=2}^{M} \frac{1}{2} (a_{z,m}^4 - a_{z,m-1}^4) (t_m -t_{m-1})\right]^{1/4}
  \label{eq:vdv-acc}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  \textrm{CF}_{a_{z}} =\frac{\max|a_{z}(t_m)|}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^{M} a_{z}^2(t_m)}}
  \label{eq:crest-factor}
\end{align}

\section{Results}
%
Results for all 67 combinations of vehicle setup, road surface, and target speed
are shown in Table~\ref{tab:summary-stroller} for strollers and
Table~\ref{tab:summary-bicycle} for cargo bicycles. These tables show the mean
values over scenario repetitions. They report the unweighted and ISO~2631-1
weighted seat pan vertical RMS acceleration, weighted seat pan magnitude RMS
acceleration, unweighted seat pan vertical VDV for the first 10 seconds of the
repetition, crest factor, peak frequency, bandwidth, and duration for all
combinations of vehicle setup, road surface, and target speed.

The magnitude (combining \(x,y,z\)) ISO weighted RMS is only a bit higher
(\(<\)4\% in  modern strollers and cargo bicycles) than the vertical (\(z\)) ISO
weighted RMS, indicating that vertical vibration is dominant. This also holds
for the Keiler tricycle, which will roll due to differing road unevenness at
left and right wheels, resulting in lateral seat motion, but this seems hardly
relevant in the current data. An exception is the Green Machine, where the
magnitude is up to 24\% higher, indicating relevant contributions of horizontal
seat pan motion that may be due to the lack of a rigid horizontal constraint on
the cot. As expected, in all cases the vertical ISO weighted RMS acceleration is
below the vertical unweighted RMS, and this reduction is on average 10\% for
modern strollers, 13\% for the vintage Green Machine, and even 56\% for the
vintage Old Rusty which sees the highest bandwidth (105 Hz). For cargo bicycles,
ISO weighting leads to an average reduction of 16\%. The Keiler with Melia on
paver bricks at 20~\si{\kph} sees a 29\% reduction with a bandwidth of
83~\si{\hertz}. These strong effects of ISO frequency weighting in some vehicle
and speed combinations are addressed further in the discussion. Below we present
ISO weighted results for which guidelines have been published using acceleration
magnitude for discomfort and vertical acceleration for health.

\subsection{Effect of Speed and Model}
%
Figure~\ref{fig:bicycle-type-compare} compares the two cargo bicycle models both
fitted with the same set of two baby seats (Melia and Pebble). Keiler sees
higher accelerations compared to the two-wheeled Urban Arrow, with a pronounced
increase on tarmac and a modest increase on paver bricks. Both vehicles show
increasing accelerations with speed.

\end{figure}

Regarding strollers, Figure~\ref{fig:stroller-type-compare} shows the vertical
RMS accelerations for each road surface for each of the five strollers, lumping
seat configurations and dummy sizes. The Maxi-Cosi and Stokke strollers have
similar mean values.  The Bugaboo has a slightly lower mean for cobblestones,
paver bricks, and sidewalk pavers. The Green Machine performs better than the
modern strollers on paver bricks, but similarly otherwise. The Old Rusty
performs better than the modern strollers on all surfaces except tarmac. All
strollers seem to experience similar accelerations on tarmac. All road surfaces
compared to tarmac at least double the RMS acceleration.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Dominant Frequency and Bandwidth}
%
Figure~\ref{fig:spectra-compare} shows frequency spectra averaged over body size
and posture for all strollers on sidewalk pavers (left) and cargo bicycles on
paver bricks. These surfaces are highly relevant as they are common in the
Netherlands. Apparently, the two vintage strollers show a lower peak frequency,
which is 4.1~\si{\hertz} for Green Machine and 5.6~\si{\hertz} for Old Rusty
whereas modern systems peak around \SIrange{7}{9}{\hertz}. This can be explained
by the more compliant suspension of the vintage strollers. The Old Rusty shows
the lowest acceleration peak, and the lowest RMS weighted acceleration, but
above 30 Hz it shows the highest power of all strollers. The Keiler sees much
higher peak values as compared to the Urban Arrow. In both cargo bicycles, the
peak frequencies range from \SIrange{6}{10}{\hertz} and hardly depend on vehicle
and speed. Figure~\ref{fig:peak-freq-dist} shows the distributions of the
dominant (peak) frequency across road surface types for each of the target
speeds. Peak frequencies range from about \SIrange{4}{11}{\hertz} across all
trials. For strollers (5~\si{\kph}), the median frequency increases from
sidewalk slabs to cobblestones and sidewalk pavers and then to tarmac and paver
bricks. For cargo bicycles, the difference in peak frequency between the two
road surfaces is not as apparent or consistent.

Figure~\ref{fig:bandwidth-dist} gives a general indication of the bandwidth
(80\% of the amplitude spectrum content) for each of the target speed groups. On
average, the bandwidth is 56~\si{\hertz} for modern strollers, 46~\si{\hertz}
for Green Machine, 105~\si{\hertz} for Old Rusty, and 44~\si{\hertz} for cargo
bicycles.

\subsection{Health Assessment}
\label{sec:health-assesment}
%
Figures \ref{fig:health-stroller} and \ref{fig:health-bicycle} show the
ISO~2631-1 weighted vertical acceleration at the seat pan for all repetitions of
the stroller and cargo bicycles, respectively. The horizontal lines in the
figure correspond to the boundaries of the ``health caution'' and  ``health
risk'' zones in the standard, which depend on the duration of exposure. If
acceleration values are above the health caution zone, ISO~2631-1 states that
``health risks are likely'' for adults in erect seating postures for a
continuous daily dose. It must be emphasised that ISO~2631-1 is based on adults
and may not result in a representative risk for infants or older children. We
use it for comparative and reference purposes and are aware of the limitations
that we explain later in the discussion and conclusion.
%
\begin{figure}

  \caption{ISO~2631-1 weighted seat pan vertical RMS acceleration of all

  zones'' for long-term exposure of adults seated erectly, daily experiencing
  these vibrations with continuous duration. ALT TEXT: Vertical acceleration for
  each cargo bicycle repetition with ISO health duration limits.}
  \label{fig:health-bicycle}
\end{figure}

For the strollers, all vibration measurements were below the health caution zone
boundary if the long-term daily continuous exposure is under 10~\si{\minute}.
Additionally, all strollers pushed over tarmac were below the zone for long-term
daily continuous exposure under 4~\si{\hour}. Pushing the Bugaboo and Maxi-Cosi
with a 0-month-old infant or the Stokke with a 9-month-old infant over
cobblestones and sidewalk slabs may have health risks for long-term daily
continuous exposures exceeding 20~\si{\minute}. For almost all strollers,
pushing over any surface except tarmac exceeded the 1~\si{\hour} risk boundary.
Notably the Bugaboo and Old Rusty with a 9-month-old infant fell at or under the
1~\si{\hour} threshold for all surfaces. The 0-month dummy experienced worse
accelerations than the 9-month dummy in the Bugaboo and Maxi-Cosi, but that was
opposite for the Stokke. Old Rusty showed the lowest overall acceleration
magnitudes.

For both cargo bicycles, accelerations exceeded the 10~\si{\minute} health risk
threshold when ridden above 20~\si{\kilo\meter\per\hour} on paver bricks and
exceeded the health risk threshold when ridden more than 1~\si{\hour} above
12~\si{\kilo\meter\per\hour} on paver bricks. All but the Keiler with the Pebble
and the 0-month dummy were below the 1~\si{\hour} threshold for riding on tarmac
at any target speed. Only the Urban Arrow with the 3-month dummy was (mostly)
under the 4~\si{\hour} threshold when ridden at either speed over tarmac. The
accelerations were lower for the Melia versus the Pebble.

\subsection{Comfort Assessment}
%
ISO~2631-1 recommends using the magnitude of the weighted seat pan acceleration
3D vector for comfort assessment. Figures \ref{fig:comfort-stroller} and
\ref{fig:comfort-bicycle} plot RMS of the acceleration magnitude along with the
comfort indicators provided in the standard that are based on adults seated in
public transit for an unspecified duration. As already mentioned above, the
ISO~2631-1 comfort assessment was compiled for adults, with many warnings and
limitations, and may not be applicable for other contexts or populations, like
infants or older children. We also include a line representing cyclists'
discomfort threshold reported by Gao~et.~al~\cite{Gao2018}. It is important to
recognise that cyclists perched on a bicycle seat seem to tolerate higher
vibration amplitudes than the public transit riders who were surveyed for the
ISO ratings. This points to possible weakness in or contradiction to the ISO
recommendations or to other factors affecting cycling discomfort (e.g., the
ability to stand on the pedals to lower vibration to the body and the head).

When following the threshold definitions from the ISO~2631-1 guidelines for the
strollers, all are at least ``a little uncomfortable'' on all surfaces. All
strollers but the Stokke are ``fairly uncomfortable'' on tarmac. All other road
surfaces are at least ``very uncomfortable''. The `Bugaboo, seat, 9 mo' and
`Green Machine, cot, 0 mo' over paver bricks and `Old Rusty, seat, 9 mo' over
paver bricks, sidewalk pavers, and sidewalk slabs are ``very uncomfortable'',
but all other strollers and surfaces are ``extremely uncomfortable''. The Old
Rusty generally shows the lowest discomfort levels.
%

  \caption{ISO~2631-1 weighted seat pan magnitude RMS acceleration of all

  dashed lines are the lower bound of the ISO~2631-1 ``comfort zones'' for

  horizontal dashed dotted line is the cyclists' vibration discomfort threshold
  as reported by Gao et. al~\cite{Gao2018}. ALT TEXT: Acceleration magnitude for
  each stroller repetition with ISO comfort limits.}
  \label{fig:comfort-stroller}
\end{figure}

Both cargo bicycles ridden at any tested speed over paver bricks, as well as the
Keiler with Pebble ridden over tarmac at high speed fall into the category
``extremely uncomfortable''. Those are also above the cyclist discomfort
threshold. The other vehicle setups fall between ``fairly uncomfortable'' and
``very uncomfortable'' over tarmac for all tested speeds. The Urban Arrow with
Melia performs, on average, the best on paver bricks and tarmac at all tested
speeds.

\section{Discussion}
%
We have presented a comprehensive set of acceleration measurements from
experiments that simulate vibrations experienced by infants in the 0-9-month age
and mass range during transportation in strollers and cargo bicycles. We
compared the average magnitude of vertical and total acceleration at the seat
pan across a variety of road surfaces and seats at typical travel speeds.
ISO~2631-1 weighted average acceleration ranged from
\SIrange{0.4}{10.7}{\mps\squared} across all tested scenarios. Strollers induced
\SIrange{0.4}{5.0}{\mps\squared} for a mean walking speed of 5.3~\si{\kph}.
Cargo bicycles induced \SIrange{0.6}{10.7}{\mps\squared} over a speed range of
\SIrange{12}{25}{\kph}.

\subsection{Surface and Speed}
%
Travelling over a tarmac surface showed the least vibration in all types of
vehicles at any speed with a range of \SIrange{0.4}{1.2}{\mps\squared}. For
strollers, the roughest surfaces being cobblestones and sidewalk slabs with
large gaps caused 5\(\times\) the acceleration experienced on tarmac, reaching
5.0~\si{\mps\squared}. More common surfaces, sidewalk pavers and paver bricks,
reach values up to 3~\si{\mps\squared}.

For cargo bicycles, travelling over paver bricks at the same speeds can
quadruple average acceleration relative to tarmac. Travelling at the maximum
allowed speed of an electric cargo bicycle (25 \si{\kph}) over paver bricks
caused average accelerations that exceeded 8~\si{\mps\squared}. Additionally,
the effect of speed on vibration was apparent for paver bricks but not so much
for tarmac. Rothhämel~et~al.~\cite{rothhamel2023comfort} contrarily found a
larger effect of speed on tarmac.

Whereas speed strongly affected the acceleration amplitude, it had less effect
on the peak frequency and the bandwidth. Peak frequency at the highest speed was
1.25\(\times\) higher for tarmac than paver bricks and bandwidth approximately
doubled for paver bricks relative to tarmac at high speeds. This suggests that
oscillations induced by the systems tested may have strong influence relative to
dominant frequencies resulting from the road surface.

\subsection{Baby Mass}
%
The size of the dummy (mass and build) had no obvious systematic effect on the
average acceleration at the seat pan, but this may simply be because we did not
isolate dummy mass as an independent variable. The absence of an effect is
contrary to Schwantiz~et~.al~\cite{Schwanitz2020}'s findings, where they tested
dummies of 5 and 10~\si{\kilogram} in a bicycle trailer. Seat pan vibrations are
transmitted to the infant’s body and the mechanical properties (mass, stiffness,
and damping) of the infant's body determine whether this excitation is amplified
or not and the degree to which each body segment is affected. Tests with more
realistic dummies or real infants along with comparisons of equivalent vehicle
setups are necessary to investigate how the infant itself moves when excited by
this level of vibration. This information is not readily available in the
literature and may be difficult to acquire due to ethical limitations and the
absence of validated infant dummies. Due to a lack of dummies validated for
vibration conditions, we tested with dummies of representative mass and body
size.  As is common for adult vibration, accelerations were measured at the
dummy-seat interface rather than on the body. This limits influence of infant
body motion to the measurements. The only effect that stood out for mass was
that, counter-intuitively, the lighter dummy had less acceleration than the
heavier dummy for the Stokke stroller, but this may well be explained by the
different stroller configurations tested for the two body sizes.

\subsection{Health}
%
Vertical RMS acceleration on uneven surfaces can be relatively large compared to
the smoothest experience on tarmac. When we compare the vibration measured for
infants in strollers and cargo bicycles with the ISO~2631-1 standard vibration
``health risk zone'' as defined for long-term exposure of adults seated erectly,
we see that:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item only strollers pushed over tarmac at 5~\si{\kph} had average
    acceleration below the ``health risk zone" for 4~\si{\hour} daily duration,
  \item walking with an infant in a stroller on cobblestones and sidewalk slabs
    can exceed the ``health risk zone'' within 20~\si{\min} to 1~\si{\hour},
    depending on the stroller model and the age of the child,
  \item cargo bicycles ridden at \SIrange{12}{25}{\kph} over tarmac delivered
    accelerations below the 1~\si{\hour} ``health risk zone'' for all but the
    Keiler with the newborn,
  \item cycling with an infant in a cargo bicycle on tarmac at 12~\si{\kph}
    can be maintained for approximately two hours before exceeding the ``health
    risk zone'',
  \item cargo bicycles ridden at \SI{12}{\kph} over paver bricks delivered
    accelerations exceed the 10~\si{\min} ``health risk zone'' for three of the
    6 vehicle setups and range between \SI{1}{\hour} to \SI{20}{\minute}
    otherwise, and
  \item cycling with an infant in a cargo bicycle on paver bricks at
    \SIrange{20}{25}{\kph} for 10~\si{\min} gives the infant a vibration load
    that equals or exceeds the ``health risk zone''.
\end{itemize}

When utilizing the ISO~2631-1 standard, we can conclude that strollers can be
pushed over paver bricks and sidewalk pavers continuously for no more than half
an hour. On extreme surfaces like cobblestones and sidewalk slabs, strollers
should be pushed slower than 5~\si{\kph} with a duration of maximal
10~\si{\min}. A stroller can be walked continuously for four hours only on
tarmac, and only if the infant is lying in the cot. If the infant is sitting,
the parent/caregiver would need to consider appropriate breaks to allow the
infant to move. Cargo bicycles carrying infants over paver bricks should slow
down to 12~\si{\kph} or preferably less, and the duration should be kept under
10~\si{\min}. When riding a cargo bicycle over tarmac at 20~\si{\kph}, the
duration should be kept under 1~\si{\hour}. At 12~\si{\kph}, cargo bicycles can
ride over tarmac for maximal 2~\si{\hour}.

The largest unweighted RMS vertical acceleration we recorded at the seat pan was
\SI{12.6}{\mps\squared}. Tsuijuchi et~al.~\cite{Tsujiuchi2014} studied inflicted
head injury by shaking trauma and give evidence based on finite element
modelling that shaking an infant at the chest with an unsupported head at
\SI{14}{\mps\squared} for \SI{2}{\second} could rupture brain bridging veins.
This is a largely different scenario with an unsupported head and accelerations
acting in different directions than in our experiments, yet it is worrisome that
the acceleration magnitudes are of the same order of magnitude.

\subsection{Comfort}
%
When considering comfort, the ISO~2631-1 guidelines estimate that adults would
report the vibrations experienced in strollers and bicycles as uncomfortable.
For strollers, the vibrations over tarmac would be rated ``fairly
uncomfortable'' and all other road surfaces would be ``very'' or ``extremely
uncomfortable''. Similar results were reported by Kok Siong~\cite{lim2018study}.
When riding a cargo bicycle over paver bricks, the vibrations would be rated as
``extremely uncomfortable'' and over tarmac spans ``fairly'' to ``extremely''.
The ISO~2631-1 comfort rating scale is derived from adult subjective ratings of
vibrations felt when riding public transit for an unspecified duration, so we
question whether the scale is appropriate for typical strolling and cycling
durations. Furthermore, the standard extensively emphasises that comfort
perception depends on many interacting factors. Gao~et~al.~\cite{Gao2018} report
that cyclists do not rate vibrations as extremely uncomfortable on normal road
surfaces, indicating a possible contradiction, especially given a bicycle saddle
is generally perceived less comfortable than a chair-style seat used in the
standard development. Lastly, it is not readily possible to assess subjective
comfort directly from infants so we can only extrapolate from children and adult
experience.

\subsection{Vehicle and Seat Design}
%
Different combinations of vehicle, seat, and baby mass cause different average
vertical accelerations at the seat pan. We are only able to compare vehicle
setups, other than comparing the same two different baby seats in both cargo
bicycles. A striking discovery is that the two tested 1970s strollers
significantly outperformed many of the modern stroller setups on most road
surfaces. The vintage strollers had more sophisticated suspension systems that
used springs, straps, and larger wheels. Stroller manufacturers may have reduced
suspension as a side effect of decreasing the size and weight of strollers and
introducing swivelling front wheels, which makes steering easier but limits
suspension design options. As an example, the ``Old Rusty'' stroller was the
only one that did not exceed the 1~\si{\hour} health risk line for any road
surface.

Both the Bugaboo and Maxi-Cosi strollers showed lower accelerations for the
heavier baby, as expected, but the Stokke stroller showed the opposite trend for
cobblestones and paver bricks. This points to design choices in the seated
configuration that may excite resonance on certain surface profiles. The
`Bugaboo, Seat, 9 mo' configuration performed better than the other modern
strollers for all non-tarmac road surfaces. The Urban Arrow performed better
than Keiler on tarmac but there was no difference on paver bricks. Additionally,
there was no difference between different seats for the 3-month-old infant. The
performance of a vehicle setup was not necessarily constant with respect to cot
or seat configuration; contrarily, performance was often significantly different
when converting for different baby ages. This may be due to designs being
optimised for one configuration.

\subsection{ISO Frequency Weighting and Bandwidth}
%
We report RMS accelerations as well as the ISO~2631-1 weighted accelerations for
comparison. Vibrations at frequencies between \SIrange{4}{11}{\hertz} showed the
largest unweighted magnitude, but there are substantial accelerations at higher
frequencies, as shown by the unweighted 80\% bandwidth. Our results show
substantial differences between RMS and VDV, highlighting the importance of
reviewing their meaning. These differences emerge from the high bandwidth of the
accelerations now measured, which greatly exceed the bandwidth of accelerations
measured with adults seated in cars (see e.g. Figure 2 in
\cite{griffin2004experimental}). Adult experiments investigating discomfort as a
function of frequency, show that significant discomfort can be measured across
all tested frequencies, being up to 80 Hz \cite{morioka2010frequency} or even up
to 315~\si{\hertz}~\cite{morioka2006magnitude} albeit with reduced sensitivity.

The ISO frequency weightings are defined for adults in more or less erect
postures with the head being unsupported, whereas we now studied dummies
representing infants from 0-9 months lying with the head directly supported. The
ISO~2631-1 weightings represent a reduced sensitivity above 8~\si{\hertz}, which
is associated with the vertical dynamics of erect seated subjects, and filter
out such high frequencies~\cite{toward2011transmission,mirakhorlo2022effects}.
However, adult experiments show greater discomfort for frequencies above
8~\si{\hertz} when lying with head supported with \SIrange{30}{90}{\degree} back
inclination compared to sitting erect without head support
\cite{BASRI2013inclined}. Higher frequencies have also been associated with
effects on the central nervous system. For instance, experiments on rats showed
brain injury visible in behaviour through functional impairment and in visual
changes of brain structures in postmortem dissection after exposure to prolonged
whole-body vibration at 30~\si{\hertz} and
5~\si{\mps\squared}~\cite{Yan2015_cumulative_brain_injury/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2015.08.007}.
In some conditions, the RMS exceeds the ISO Weighted RMS substantially,
warranting further research on the effects of higher frequencies, in particular
for conditions where the head is supported and for children. Meanwhile, a
conservative approach is to (also) consider the unweighted RMS in the design and
evaluation of transport means for very young children.

\section{Conclusion}
%
\subsection{Summary}
%
The results herein raise concerns about transporting infants in strollers and
cargo bicycles. If the user's behaviour is not adjusted to avoid rough surfaces
or to travel slowly over them when transporting an infant, there are potential
health risks and discomfort from daily and repeated exposure to large vibrations
over a longer time. However, there is no direct evidence that connects
whole-body vibration as measured in this study to infant harm or negative health
effects and discomfort, thus we can only extrapolate from the limited guidelines
on adults in occupational settings. We did measure vibrations that would not be
permitted for adults to maintain long-term occupational health and it is
reasonable to believe we should not subject our infants to the same. The
preceding statement should certainly not be interpreted to mean that vibration
lower than these limits is deemed acceptable for infants. The relative
vulnerability of infants points more towards infant limits being lower than
those of adults. Further research to establish direct evidence to infant health
and comfort would possibly permit more or less caution than we conclude below in
our recommendations.

It is well known that whole-body vibration can be attenuated with good
suspension design. We see this in the drastic historical evolution of
suspensions in automobiles, buses, trucks, and trains. We do not see this same
kind of attention to suspension in strollers, cargo bicycles, and baby seats for
these vehicles. Both walking and cycling are well known to offer great societal
and personal benefits over travelling by car, so it behoves us all to optimise
transport for infants in these two modes of transportation.

\subsection{Recommendations}
%
Our conclusions result primarily from the recommended application of ISO~2631-1.
It is of utmost importance to recognise that this standard cautions against
extending the use of the standard to situations for which its supporting data
were not derived. The standard is based primarily on pre-1997 studies of adult
whole-body vibration in occupational durations (\SIrange{4}{8}{\hour} daily
dose) or during public transport.
%
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{The recommendations in standard ISO~2631-1 have not been based on or
  validated for infants, children, or young adults, nor for recumbent or
  reclined seating postures with the head supported. Additionally, the
  admissible durations for health are not validated for daily short durations or
  shorter lifetime accumulation that dominate stroller and cargo bicycle travel
  with infants. So, our recommendations must be taken with caution, at least
  until more research is done to improve the standard guidance.}
\end{quote}
%
Nevertheless, the following list provides recommendations for users,
researchers, designers, and manufacturers based on the findings of this paper
that we believe stand in spite of the standard's limitations:
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Manufacturers of strollers, cargo bicycles, and seats should test for
    vibrations for all expected surface types and ranges of relevant body sizes
    and postures to ensure that their designs isolate vibrations well for all
    use conditions. Testing across relevant body sizes is especially important
    for strollers, due to the high mass of the infant relative to the mass of
    the stroller.
  \item Manufacturers should collaborate in testing and report their results
    publicly, similar to the safety ratings of the automobile industry. For the
    combined use of cargo bicycles and baby seats, manufacturers should
    collaborate in this effort.
  \item Manufacturers and scientists should collaborate to develop metrics and
    testing procedures for the long-term goal of a new standard.
  \item Designers should ensure that adequate vibration isolation occurs for
    vehicles that have multiple configurations (e.g. recumbent vs. erect
    seating).
  \item Designers and manufacturers should incorporate better suspension
    systems, as currently occurring vibrations can be drastically reduced.
    Useful information may be derived from past designs with better suspension.
  \item New cycling roads and sidewalks should have a tarmac-like smoothness.
    Cobblestones should be avoided.
  \item Users should consider limiting their speed when walking with strollers
    or riding over surfaces rougher than tarmac, as bumpier surfaces aggravate
    accelerations.
  \item Users are suggested to limit the duration of transport over surfaces
    rougher than tarmac to periods that do not exceed 10-30 continuous minutes
    depending on the system (quality of suspension, larger tyres or wheels) and
    other countermeasures like adequate non-vibration breaks in between. When
    transporting over tarmac, continuous durations should not exceed 4 hours,
    and need to include regular breaks, if only to allow the infant to move free
    from the seat harness.
  \item Users should preferably ride any cargo bicycle at a speed of maximal
    12~\si{\kph} over surfaces rougher than tarmac. E-cargo bicycles can easily
    reach the maximum speed of 25~\si{\kph}. Infants should only be transported
    for short durations when riding over non-tarmac surfaces at these speeds.
  \item Standard ISO~2631-1 is not validated to characterise health and
    comfort effects of vibration for infants or children, for short travel
    durations, for vibration accumulation over only a small number of years, or
    for non-erect seating. However, this is the only available standard in the
    literature assessing health and comfort levels on vibrations, and should be
    used as a benchmark. More research should be done to enable the design of a
    standard on vibration that is applicable for infant transportation.
