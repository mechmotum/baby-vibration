abstract = {Introduction: Whole-body vibration has direct impacts on driver vigilance by increasing physical and cognitive stress on the driver, which leads to drowsiness, fatigue and road traffic accidents. Although sleep deprivation, sleep apnoea and alcohol consumption can also lead to driver drowsiness, exposure to steady vibration is the factor most readily controlled by changes to vehicle design, yet it has received comparatively less attention. Methods: This review investigated interrelationships between the various components of whole-body vibration and the physiological and cognitive parameters that lead to driver drowsiness, as well as the effects of vibration parameters (frequency, amplitude, waveform and duration). Vibrations transmitted to the driver body from the vehicle floor and/or seat have been considered for this review, whereas hand-arm vibration, shocks, acute or transient vibration were excluded from consideration. Results: Drowsiness is affected by interactions between the frequency, amplitude, waveform and duration of the vibration. Under optimal conditions, whole-body vibration can induce significant drowsiness within 30 min. Low frequency whole-body vibrations, particularly vibrations of 4–10 Hz, are most effective at inducing drowsiness. This review notes some limitations of current studies and suggests directions for future research. Conclusions: This review demonstrated a strong causal link exists between whole-body vibration and driver drowsiness. Since driver drowsiness has been established to be a significant contributor to motor vehicle accidents, research is needed to identify ways to minimise the components of whole-body vibration that contribute to drowsiness, as well as devising more effective ways to counteract drowsiness. Practical Applications: By raising awareness of the vibrational factors that contribute to drowsiness, manufacturers will be prompted to design vehicles that reduce the influence of these factors.}

This experimental study investigated the discomfort arising from whole-body vertical vibration when sitting on a rigid seat with no backrest and with a backrest inclined at 0° (upright), 30°, 60°, and 90° (recumbent). Within each of these five postures, 12 subjects judged the discomfort caused by vertical sinusoidal whole-body vibration (at frequencies from 1 to 20 Hz at magnitudes from 0.2 to 2.0 m s−2 r.m.s.) relative to the discomfort produced by a reference vibration (8 Hz at 0.4 m s−2 r.m.s.). With 8-Hz vertical vibration, the subjects also judged vibration discomfort with each backrest condition relative to the vibration discomfort with no backrest. The locations in the body where discomfort was experienced were determined for each frequency at two vibration magnitudes. Equivalent comfort contours were determined for the five conditions of the backrest and show how discomfort depends on the frequency of vibration, the presence of the backrest, and the backrest inclination. At frequencies greater than about 8 Hz, the backrest increased vibration discomfort, especially when inclined to 30°, 60°, or 90°, and there was greater discomfort at the head or neck. At frequencies around 5 and 6.3 Hz there was less vibration discomfort when sitting with an inclined backrest.}

To examine the vibrations of the rider and infants, a vibration model and a simulation system were designed for this bicycle--rider--infant system. The vibration characteristics in the analytical results were compared with the experimentally measured results. The effects of the vibrations on the occupants owing to the altered centroid of the bicycle were investigated. This investigation indicated that the analytical results corresponded with the measurement results for the occupants. When the centroid of the bicycle was moved forward, the root mean square (RMS) acceleration values for the front infant increased, whereas the maximum acceleration values decreased. In contrast, both the RMS and maximum values of acceleration for the rear infant increased when the centroid of the bicycle was moved forward. However, both the RMS and maximum values of acceleration for the rider increased when the centroid of the bicycle was moved backward. On the basis of these results, a relationship between the centroid of the bicycle and the transient response of the occupants was found by using the proposed vibration analysis system.},

Physically active commuting to and from work provides a promising mode for such activity. In a series of three studies we explored more specifically the population prevalence, the physiological effectiveness, and the promotional possibilities of commuting to work by walking and cycling in a mid-size Finnish town. The results of the questionnaire survey indicated that while about one-third of the working-age sample commuted by walking or cycling an additional one-quarter were in a position to either begin or increase physically active commuting. The controlled intervention study showed that this kind of moderate-intensity, high-frequency activity improved the health-related fitness and selected indices of metabolic health. The promotion project in a large industrial plant demonstrated that walking and cycling during work trips can be successfully promoted by relatively low cost measures. These experiences suggest that physically active commuting to work offers substantial potential as a health-enhancing measure for working-age population.},

  abstract = {There is a growing recognition of the role that walking and cycling can make in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by substituting motorized travel, particularly on short trips. However, there is a lack of evidence at the micro level on the realistic, empirically derived potential of walking and cycling to displace motorized travel and thus reduce GHG emissions. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential for GHG emissions savings from replacing short car trips with walking and cycling and the extent to which high quality infrastructure for walking and cycling may influence day-to-day travel decisions, change the spatial and temporal nature of local journeys and impact on overall GHG emissions from motorised travel.
  To achieve this aim this study conducted an in-depth observational study of a purposively selected cohort of 50 residents in Cardiff, Wales. Using a mixed-method approach detailed quantitative and qualitative data were collected for each participant using personal Global Position System (GPS) devices, 7-day travel diaries and contextual interviews over two seasonally matching 7-day time periods in 2011 and 2012. GHG emissions for motorized travel modes were derived using journey distance, vehicle technology details and average speeds obtained from the GPS data. The spatial and contextual data provided new insights into the complexities of walking behaviour and factors influencing cycling for everyday travel or recreation, including route choice decisions, activity destinations and the role of the new infrastructure to enable change.
  We found significant potential of active travel to substitute short car trips, with sizeable impacts on carbon emissions from personal travel. Half of all car trips were less than 3 miles long. Taking into account individual travel patterns and constraints, walking or cycling could realistically substitute for 41% of short car trips, saving nearly 5% of CO2e emissions from car travel. This was on top of 5% of ‘avoided’ emissions from cars due to existing walking and cycling. The evolving high quality walking and cycling infrastructure in the case study area was unlikely to promote a significant reduction in carbon emissions from (displaced) car journeys on its own.
  The study contributes to the debate on how to achieve stringent low carbon targets in urban transport. The combination of methods for data collection developed and employed in this study also helps to inform future research on the wider environmental impacts of active travel, including ‘co-benefits’ of improved air quality, reduced noise and reduced fossil fuel use.},

  abstract = {Background: Ecological models emphasize that cycling for transport is determined by an interplay between individual, physical and social environmental factors. The current study investigated (a) which physical and social environmental factors determine adolescents' preferences towards cycling for transport and (b) which individual, physical and social environmental factors are associated with their intention to actually cycle for transport.
  Methods: An online questionnaire consisting of questions on individual and social environmental variables, and 15 choice-based conjoint tasks with manipulated photographs was completed by 882 adolescents (55.3% male; 13.9 +/- 1.6 years). Within the choice tasks, participants were asked to indicate which of two situations they would prefer to cycle to a friend's house. The manipulated photographs were all modified versions of one semi-urban street which differed in the following physical micro-environmental attributes (separation of cycle path, evenness of cycle path, speed limit, speed bump, traffic density, amount of vegetation and maintenance). In addition, each photograph was accompanied by two sentences which described varying cycling distances and co-participation in cycling (i.e. cycling alone or with a friend). After each choice task participants were also asked if they would actually cycle in that situation in real life (i.e. intention). Hierarchical Bayes analyses were performed to calculate relative importances and part-worth utilities of environmental attributes. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate which individual, physical and social environmental factors were associated with adolescents' intention to actually cycle for transport.
  Results: Adolescents' preference to cycle for transport was predominantly determined by separation of cycle path, followed by shorter cycling distance and co-participation in cycling. Higher preferences were observed for a separation between the cycle path and motorized traffic by means of a hedge versus a curb, versus a marked line. Similar findings were observed for intention to cycle. Furthermore, evenness of the cycle path and general maintenance of the street were also of considerable importance among adolescents, but to a lesser extent.
  Conclusions: Results of this experimental study justify investment by local governments in well-separated cycling infrastructure, which seemed to be more important than cycling distance and the social environment.},

The neutral position was considered as basic seat position and was compared with upward, downward, forward and backward seat positions. The initial bout was repeated at the end of the recording session. Discomfort increased for upward and backward condition compared with neutral (P<0.05). Normalized surface electromyography from gastrocnemius decreased in the downward and forward position but increased in the upward and backward position. The minimum force became less negative for forward position compared with neutral seat position (P<0.05). The degree of variability of centre of pressure increased in the upward and backward position and the entropy of the centre of pressure of sitting posture for backward position decreased compared with neutral seat position (P<0.05). The present study revealed that consecutive changes of seat position over time lead to increase in discomfort as well as alterations of the biomechanics of cycling.}

  abstract = {Attainment of cycling comfort on urban roads encourages people to use bicycles more frequently, which has social and environmental benefits such as to improve air quality, alleviate congestion and reduce carbon emissions. Vibration is perceived by cyclists as one of the most important indicators of cycling comfort, and it greatly influences people's choice of bicycles. However, a comprehensive correlation between cyclists' perception of comfort and cycling vibration has not yet been established in the current knowledge. In this study, a total of 46 sections of 24 urban roads (approximately 11,500m in length of asphalt pavements) in the city of Xi'an, China, were selected for field test. An innovative Dynamic Cycling Comfort (DCC) measure system consisting of an accelerometer, GPS logger and smart phone, was installed on the hand bar of a shared bicycle typically used in Xi'an, to record the dynamic data of vibration, trail, speed and mileage. Reliability of the DCC was verified, and the effect of test conditions (speed, bicycle type) on vibration evaluated. The vibration data were processed in accordance with ISO 2631 to quantitatively characterize the vibration level on each tested section. Furthermore, a total of 17 volunteers participated in this test, and the cyclists' perception of vibration in each section was obtained via a purpose-designed questionnaire. The volunteers' perception of environmental factors such as scenery, weather, road geometry, congestion and traffic condition were summarized to evaluate the influencing factors for cycling comfort. The thresholds of acceptable rate, comfort level and vibration perceptible level were established, based on the correlation between cycling vibration awv and subjective perception described in the questionnaire. In addition, the cycling comfort on the asphalt pavements (3521 m) within Qujiangchi Park was mapped, to demonstrate the practical use of this study. Results showed that the DCC is able to capture the cycling data timely and accurately. K-means clustering analysis showed that the cycling vibration increases with the increase of cycling speed. Meantime, a heavier shared bicycle with solid tires results in higher cycling vibration compared with a lighter one with inflatable tires. In addition, the comfort level is proportional to acceptable rate, and inversely proportional to vibration perceptible level. The cycling comfort mapping for Qujiangchi Park proved that there is great potential to use the vibration (comfort) data to monitor pavement surface quality and for cyclists to determine their desirable cycling route. Results of this study should be interested by cyclists, bicycle manufacturers, transport planners and road authorities.

  abstract = {The most serious head injury resulting from shaken baby syndrome (infant brain injuries resulting from violent shaking attributed to child abuse) is acute subdural hematoma (ASDH). ASDH in infants has a high mortality rate and results in serious permanent injury. However, medical practitioners rely on experience and intuition to determine the cause of infant head injuries because it is difficult to gather accurate evidence from third parties. Therefore, in this study, we have conducted vibration experiment and simulation analysis reproducing the shaking action to provide a scientific basis for the determination of shaken baby syndrome. The finite element model of a six-month-old-infant head is constructed from adult head models and CT scan images of an infant head. The input value is defined as head angle and head displacement obtained from the vibration experiments using a six-month-old-infant dummy. ASDH is caused by the relative rotational motion between the skull and the brain with a rupture of the bridging veins that connect the skull and brain. Accordingly, we have evaluated the relative movement between the skull and brain and measured the stretch ratio of the bridging veins. Then compared this ratio with the threshold, which is the rupture value. As a result, the violent shaking action regarded as shaken baby syndrome abuse ruptures the bridging veins and causes ASHD. As the brain movement follows the skull, the bridging veins are stretched greatly depending on the forced skull movement and the brain's inertia. And the risk of ASDH to occur is high enough to vibrate the infant longer because the stretch ratio increases as time passes in the simulation.},
